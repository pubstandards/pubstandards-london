    <h2>About Pub Standards</h2>
    <p>Pub Standards is a regular get-together for web folk. We're open to everyone, regardless of age, experience, or beverage preference.</p>
    <p>Started in 2005 and still going strong, the London chapter of Pub Standards is the original, and still the best place in London to enjoy a tasty beverage with like-minded web people.
    <p>This is the post-conference drinks and chat without the conference.</p>

    <h2>When and where is it?</h2>
    <p>London Pub Standards is currently held at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q={{venues[-1].address}}">{{venues[-1].name}}</a>.</p>

    <p>Prior to 2020, it was held for 15 years at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=31%20Gresse%20Street,%20London%20W1T%201QS">The Bricklayers Arms</a> on Gresse Street, W1, with

    </p>
    
    <p>Pub Standards is always held on the <em>middle Thursday</em> of the month, as decided by
        <a href="https://github.com/pubstandards/THE_ALGORITHM/">the Algorithm</a>.</p>
    
    <p>In between Pub Standards events, those requiring more beer can organise a Substandards event. They are named
        events (not numbered) and are conventionally held at a new, unvisited pub. If you'd like to propose a Substandards
        event, simply email the <a href="/keep-in-touch">mailing list</a> with a name, date, and location. See
        the <a href="/previous">list of previous events</a> to find out where we've been drinking before.
